# TailwindCSS

In this repo i basically try to implement all the concepts of tailwind css that i have learned in my journey 


In the tailwind css we have to first install the node js that is come with npm which is used to install tailwind css using the PostCSS method 
**npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer** 

and then we willget the node_modules folder and then also initilizes with the **npm init -y** to initilaize the empty npm folder 
moreover use the **npm install vite** which is used for enhancing the web dev experience 

and then last write the **npx tailwindcss init**  it will initilizes the tailwind css and provide the tailwind config file in which e have to make the content ["*"]
in the package.json write the scripts tag   
"scripts": {
    "start": "vite"
  },
